Management
==========

This is the Ansible playbook for my infrastructure. This infrastrucure is built on three elements:

* CentOS 6 
* CentOS 6 configured according to the DISA STIG for RHEL 6
* XenServer 6.2 based VMs

Please check these closely before using in your own environment. They work well for me but not for you.
